# EventTrackerProject

## Overview

This is the Week 14 Project for the Skill Distillery Full-Stack Java Bootcamp.  This is the second stage of the week 12/13 project, now requiring students to display their ability to connect their Java/SpringJPA back-end to an Angular front-end.  For this ongoing project, the theme of the event tracker has been the tracking and recording of unsubstantiated phenomena (e.g., paranormal activity).

*Per instructor advice, this Event Tracker currently only makes limited use of one table in a database.  However, this will likely be a continued project after graduation.  

## Login Information

Send your preferred web browser to: http://35.164.69.220:8080/, where you will be directed immediately to the home page of the Phenomenomicon.  This page is all-encompassing and contains all of the currently-available functions.  Upon arriving at the index, you will be greeted and shown an itemized list of the current encounters in the Phenomenomicon.  

## Instructions

If you have any interest in reviewing any of the encounters, you simply have to click on any of the encounters.  All pertinent details will then be displayed to the right, including an image of the entity involved, and a brief narrative of the encounter.  

Upon loading the specific encounter, User will be given the  option to change/update the entry should they feel it necessary, or delete it altogether.  All descriptive fields are modifiable, and any changes can be made into effect upon the clicking of 'update'.  Alternatively, should User feel the encounter no longer needs to be included in the database, they can choose to delete it outright by clicking on the 'delete' button.  Any actions taken to modify or remove the database will occur immediately and the changes will be immediately reflected in the index.

Lastly, if User wishes to add an encounter, this option is made available at the bottom of the index list.  Based on the difficulty of sometimes obtaining substantial information on these encounters, adding encounters is flexible with the data required.  After clicking the 'submit' button, the index is immediately updated to allow user to review the data entered.  Cancelling the request will clear the form.

Have fun!

## Key Lessons Learned

1. Preparing an Angular front-end for this project provided extensive practice in JavaScript and JavaType, data binding, creation of components and services, css and Bootstrap integration, and the utilization of new technologies (e.g. Visual Studio Code) to efficiently apply these languages.
2. This project provided an extremely flexible and efficient way to utilize JavaScript in front-end development, as well as providing a more structured layout.  Angular is an excellent alternative to coding in raw JavaScript.
